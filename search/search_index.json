Going from top to bottom, Visual Studio Code is a common choice for code editing, and the one we will be using to write our own Go code. Docker allows us to create isolated development environments through containers. Finally, the VSCode Dev Container extension will allow us to open out own project within a Docker container.</p> <p>Notice</p> <p>With docker installed, VS Code might prompt you to install the extension already. Otherwise, search for the Dev Container extension in the app or use the link above. </p>"},{"location":"tutorials/go-setup/#step-1-create-a-new-directory","title":"Step 1: Create a New Directory","text":"<p><pre><code>mkdir go-dev-container\ncd go-dev-container\n</code></pre> This will create a new directory, called go-dev-container, and change your current directory to the one you just created.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/go-setup/#step-2-initialize-a-git-repository","title":"Step 2: Initialize a Git Repository","text":"<p><pre><code>git init\n</code></pre> This turns your directory into a git repository, to put it simply.</p> <p>Notice</p> <p>This does not sync your branch with a remote GitHub repository.
